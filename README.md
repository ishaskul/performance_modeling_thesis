# A Queuing Network and Continuous Time Markov Chain based Hybrid Model that is capable of estimating the CPU Utilization, Power Consumption and Energy Consumption values for microservices-based applications deployed in a distributed setting

### Setup
- Navicate to the project directory and run the following command to setup virtual environment for python locally and install all the required dependencies required to run this model :
  
```bash
python3 setup_venv.py
```
- Activate the virtual environment by running :
 
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### How to run the model ? 
- Run the following bash script to run the model as well as all the data analysis scripts that will generate all the required comparison plots and error metrics
   
```bash
./run_model_and_analysis_scripts.sh <app_name> <user_scenario_name>
```
Where, valid combinations for app_name and user_scenario_name are : 
| App Name        | User Scenario Name  |
|----------------|--------------------|
| bookstore      | buy_books          |
| social_network | compose_posts      |
| social_network | follow_users       |
